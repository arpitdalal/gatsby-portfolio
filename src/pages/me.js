            <div>
                <p>I was 13 when I first saw the code of a game named Tetris.</p>
                <p>I was fascinated by how a few lines of code that I could not even understand can do so much visually and give such a remarkable output.</p>
                <p>Since then I was curious to know how to write code that can give such an amazing experience to the world.</p>
                <p>So, I learned Java and built my version of the game.</p>
                <p>Soon I discovered that I want to be a part of the web dev community and started learning web technologies including PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.</p>

          <div className="my-today text-left mt-5">
            <h2 className="text-center">Where do I stand today?</h2>
            <div>
              <p>I have hands-on experience with 2 full stacks including LAMP and MERN to develop a full scalable web application with designing the architecture of the application and the database that supports the application, developing and testing every part of the application, deploying it to the production based environment, and maintaining it after the deployment is successful.</p>
              <p>Moreover, I have built web applications using technologies like Node.js, Express.js, React.js, Gatsby.js WordPress, Laravel, WooCommerce, PHP, and even JAMstack.</p>
              <p>I have created designs using CSS-frameworks like Bootstrap, Semantic-UI, and Materialize to name a few.</p>
              <p>And I also know how to facilitate controlling the versions of an application using Git.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, I have built straight coded sites with working PHP forms from a picture or a photoshop file. I have hands-on experience of creating a responsive website where the designs are within Photoshop, Adobe XD, Figma, etc tools.</p>
